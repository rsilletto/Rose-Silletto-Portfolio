    <h1>Ocean Cleanup 2</h1>
    </header>

    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
        You play as a diver collecting as many different types of trash in the ocean as you can in a limited amount of time. 
        You get points assigned based on how much trash of various types you are able to collect.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>
        Arcade
    </p>
    
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>
        Desktop and mobile web browser
    </p>
    
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
        The game is about a diver collecting trash to clean up the ocean-- a simplistic anti-plastic, environmental narrative.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        I plan to use Retro-inspired arcade style graphics.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The player will move the diver around the screen using the mouse. Trash is collected by moving onto trash and clicking on it.
        Instructions for how to play will be provided on the start screen.
    </p>

        Developing the game and working towards a polished final result was a struggle. I encountered a lot of obstacles along the way that required creativity and perseverance in solving them.
        This project definitely helped improve my troubleshooting and debugging skills.
        Throughout development I found many errors and problems, such as creating a timer that functioned the way I wanted and could be displayed on the screen.
        I struggled a lot with coding the timer-- I attempted multiple methods (setTimeout(), Date() ) before finding one that worked properly.
        I also had to continuously test the difficulty of the game with regards to the number of trash and sharks that were generated for each level. 
        I wanted to make sure that the game was balanced and not impossible but also not too easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I expanded the game's scope during development-- I started out with just the base concept, using less features than the proposal. This version included one type of trash that awarded a static number of points for each one collected.
        Once the timer was implemented, I added multiple types of trash which awarded different points (plastic is 10 points, others are 5). I also added a 'high score' tracker using localStorage so the player can compete against themself and have a goal to work towards.
