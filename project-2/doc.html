        I decided to create a D&D Character Generator because I enjoy playing D&D so it was a web application concept that appealed to me.
        I am using the Open5E API to access D&D classes, races, and backgrounds. Each character attribute (race, class, background) is randomly generated from the options available in the API.

    <p>
        For the page's styling I have used black, red, and parchment to mimic the D&D logo and D&D sourcebook aesthetic.

        I have referenced the Github coding tutorials and previous coding exercises.
